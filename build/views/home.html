<h1> Welcome to the home view </h1>
<hr/>

<h3>Home</h3>
<p>This is the home view, it uses the main controller. It is accessed at / or /#/.</p>
<p>{{angularTest}}</p>
<br/>

<h3>View 1 &amp; 2</h3>
<p>The first and second views share the same controller as home. Their routes are /#/view1 and /#/view2.</p>
<br/>

<h3>View 3 &amp; 3/id</h3>
<p>The Third route can also take an argument called id. To specify the id, just add it to the normal route of /#/3/</p>
<br/>
<p>Try it, enter an ID like your name and hit go:</p>
<p><input type="text" ng-model="view3id"> <a ng-href="#/view3/{{view3id}}"> GO</a></p>
<br/>

<h3>Add more</h3>
<p>Add as many views as you need. Just create a new .html file in /views and create a route in angular.</p>

<h1>Styling the app</h1>
<p> There is a stylesheet.scss and three partial files set up with limitted styles pre-defined. Add a css framework or define your own styles to get the site looking snazzy.</p>
